<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>NEStrisChamp works with the concepts of room. Each user has 2 rooms:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A single-player Private room - to capture your own gameplay.</li>
	<li>A multi-player Match room - to organise and comment on other player matches.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is for players to OCR their game frames into the correct room.</p>

<p>For single player rooms, you just need to send your game frames into the room and into the view for them to be rendered.</p>

<p>For Math room, you may invite as many people as you want to be producers, and you'll select who out of the room members gets to be player 1 and player 2.</p>

<h1>Architecture and Terminology</h1>

<p>In single player mode, frame data is passed straight from the producer into 1 or more views.</p>

<p><img src="./architecture_1_player.png" /></p>

<p>In competition mode, all producers emit data, but The room owner assigns a given producer to be player 1 and anotherproducer to be player 2. Only the game frame of these 2 players are sent to the views.</p>

<p><img src="./architecture_2_players.png" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Room: A broker of connection, frame data, and commands</li>
<li>Producer: an entity doing 1) OCR and 2) emitting frames into the room</li>
<li>View: Receives the frame data and redraw the scene, can accept other commands (e.g. to set player names)</li>
<li>Admin UI: For Multi player rooms, the admin room allow the room owner to control which producer are player 1 and player 2, Update the player names, and assign victories.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="urls">URL scheme</h1>

<h2>Views</h2>

<p>Since views are typically setup in OBS, the URL needs to identify the room owner by itself, This is achieved by assigning a scret to each user that can placed in the URL. It's not super secure, but whatever, this tool is not hosting state secrets -_-</p>

<p><a href="http://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/view/simple_1p/USER_SECRET">http://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/view/<b>LAYOUT_NAME</b>/<b>USER_SECRET</b></a></p>

<p>The layouts available so far are as follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Single Player
		<ul>
			<li><b>das_trainer</b>: a stats-heay interface</li>
			<li><b>simple_1p</b>: a simple UI with Tetris rates and Droughts</li>
			<li><b>invisible_tetris</b>: A renderer for Invisible Tetris</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Multi Player
		<ul>
			<li><b>ctwc</b>: A CTWC inspired layout</li>
			<li><b>ctjc</b>: a CTJC inspired layout</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>At your first login, a secret would have been generated for you and added to your user record. You can see it in your personl renderer links which are available <a href="http://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/renderers">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully in the future, users will be able to contribute their own template.</p>

<h2>Producer</h2>

<p>To produce frame into your own private room, visit <a href="https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/producer">https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/producer</a></p>


<p>To attach yourself as a producer to another user's room (typically the link will be passed to you an invitation), the links will be of the form</p>

<p>http://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/u/<b>TWITCH_USERNAME</b>/producer</p>

<h2>Admin</h2>

<p>To administer your competition room, visit <a href="https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/admin">https://nestrischamps.herokuapp.com/room/admin</a></p>


<h1 id="ocr">OCR and Calibration</h1>

<p>OCR is supported in browser for both device capture and screen capture.</p>

<p>2 default game roms are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Classic Tetris</p><img src="./capture_classic.png" /></li>
	<li><p><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3761/">Das Trainer</a></p><img src="./capture_das_trainer.png" /></li>
</ul>

<p>The fields that need to be OCR-ed per rom are fixed (see highlighted areas above)</p>

<p>There is a built-in automatic calibrator but it doesn't work to well, so you should always ajust the areas selected for calibration to be as close as possible to the desired outcome.</p>

<h2>Digits</h2>

<p>The capture area should "hug" the digits on top, right, bottom, left, (using 0 as a reference), like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li><img src="./digits_2_0.png" /></li>
	<li><img src="./digits_6_0.png" /></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if you calibrate something that starts with a 1, the capture area should NOT hug the one on the left (notice the black strip on the left).</p>

<ul>
	<li><img src="./digits_18.png" /></li>
</ul>

<h2>Preview</h2>

<p>To calibrate the preview properly, run the calibration in level 0 over multiple pieces, such that:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Pieces S, Z, L, J, T, O are "hugged" TOP and BOTTOM in the capture area</p>
		<img src="./preview_s.png" />
		<img src="./preview_z.png" />
		<img src="./preview_l.png" />
		<img src="./preview_j.png" />
		<img src="./preview_t.png" />
		<img src="./preview_o.png" />
	</li>

	<li><p>Piece I is "hugged" LEFT and RIGHT in the capture area</p>
		<img src="./preview_i.png" />
	</li>
</ul>

<p>"hugged" means there is no black border</p>

<h2>Current Piece (DAS Trainer only)</h2>

<p>To calibrate the preview properly, run the calibration in level 0 over multiple pieces, such that:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Pieces L, J are "hugged" TOP ONLY in the capture area (notice there's a black strip at the bottom)</p>
		<img src="./cur_piece_l.png" />
		<img src="./cur_piece_j.png" />
	</li>
	<li><p>Pieces S, Z, T, O are "hugged" BOTTOM ONLY in the capture area (notice there's a black strip on top)</p>
		<img src="./cur_piece_s.png" />
		<img src="./cur_piece_z.png" />
		<img src="./cur_piece_t.png" />
		<img src="./cur_piece_o.png" />
	</li>

	<li><p>Piece I is "hugged" LEFT and RIGHT in the capture area</p>
		<img src="./cur_piece_i.png" />
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Color (Classic Tetris only)</h2>

<p>Reading colors from the frame helps matching the block colors when scanning the field.</p>

<p>The are 2 colors to read: color1 and color2, and they should be read from the pieces stats on the left by selecting one block from the J piece, and one block from the Z piece</p>

<p>The blocks should be chosen like this</p>

<p><img src="./statistics_colors.png" /></p>

<p>The selection should not include any black border</p>

<uL>
	<li><img src="./color_1.png" /></li>
	<li><img src="./color_2.png" /></li>
</uL>

<h2>Field</h2>

<p>To calibrate the field capture, try to stak pieces on the left, right, and bottom,  and even to block the top-left and top-right.</p>

<p>Having done that, hug the capture on the left and the top, and leave a thin black border on the bottom and right, like this:</p>

<p><img src="./field.png" /></p>


<h1 id="obs">OBS / Streamlabs setup</h1>

<p>All layouts so far are 720p (1280x720), which is a good compromise of real estate vs. draw time and upload bandwidth requirements. But feel free to stretch the layout to fit a 1080p canva</p>

<p>The Browser Source setup should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="./streamlabs_browser_source.png" /></p>


<h1 id="admin">Administering a Room</h1>

<p><img src="./admin_ui.png" /></p>

<p>In the admin panel, you get to see who is connected to the room, and select the desired producers as player 1 and player 2</p>

<p>The Name and Avatar are taken from Twitch data, but can be updated to suit.</p>

<p>The number of match to get to victory can change ("Best of" dropdown)</p>

<p>Each player has a heart control, the heart can be clicked to attribute victories.</p>

<p>The "Winner" button displays a little animation in the field to show the winner and loser of the match. Do NOT click it until both players have topped out! If the winning player is chasing a maxout or what not, wait till he/she is done before clicking.</p>

<p>Finally the "Clear Victories" button resets the victory for both players to 0, and stops the winner animation.</p>


<h1 id="binary_frame_format">Binary frame format</h1>

<p>All captured frames are sent in binary and weight 568 bits (71 bytes) per frame. ON a capture setup of 60fps, the game stream requirements are therefore 71*60 = 4,260 B/s (~4KB/s).</p>

<p>They have the format below.</p>

<p>Game fields may be null (like das trainer's instant das when sending classic frames), in which case, the bits should all be set to 1.</p>

<h1>Ideas for improvements</h1>

<p>As with any software, there's always more... "More, more, more, more, more" as the GOAT would say.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make this site look nice: some branding and fancy site styling</li>
	<li>Follow the usual web delivery best practices (pack assets, use cdn for static assts, etc.)</li>
	<li>Let users contributes their own layout</li>
	<li>Ability for producers to websocket connect to random servers and send their frames there (Do what you want style!)</li>
	<li>Anonymous rooms</li>
	<li>By-invite only room (restricted access)</li>
	<li>Make producers only push game frames to websocket when room instructs</li>
	<li>Web RTC between the producers and view. nestrischamp would act as signaling coordinator. This could be useful, because heroku servers are in the US, so when players and commentators are all in EU or Asia for example, the game frames still go all around the frames, which is not efficient (to be tested if OBS Browser Source supports web RTC).</li>
	<li>Record the game in DB. If games are stored, it opens the door for replay, match up of any past games, and more (?). But storage requirements might be a pain. Say a game lasts 6mins, at 60fps, storage size requirement per game would be 6mins * 60secs * 60fps * 72bytes = 1,555,200 bytes (~1.5MB)</li>
</ul>
